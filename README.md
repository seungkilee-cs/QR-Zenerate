# Zen Browser Mod - QR Zenerate

A QR Code Generator Mod for Zen Browser, because I had this in Brave but it's not on Zen Browser.

## Basic Understanding of QR Code Generation

### Input Encoding

### Data Structuring

### Error Correction

### Module Placement

### Masking

### Rendering

## Existing Libraries

## Plan

- Build from scratch
- Use library
- Compare the result -> could be insignificant for something as short as the url.
